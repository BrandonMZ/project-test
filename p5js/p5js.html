    <b class="imagetext"> 3. 'Paper Mario' Paper Mario is a role-playing video game developed by Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64 home video game console. To oversimplified what Paper Mario is all about, its your typical normal super mario game, but in a world where everything is paper. And yes, you have to save the princess and defeat the evil villian Bowser using the amazing tools and equipment the game gives you in order to finish the game. 
        With the game still having its charm like the other Mario games but as well as changing the style, gameplay, and adding a possible new series to the franchise, we give Paper Mario THIRD place on our best 2000 games so far!
