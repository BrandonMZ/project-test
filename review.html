        It is the successor to the original PlayStation, as well as the second installment in the PlayStation brand of consoles. The original has sold about 100+ MILLIONS of consoles world wide!
    The brand new PlayStation 2 will bring in exclusive titles like, "God Of War," "Ace of Combat," and many more games stated by Sony themselves. And when we say exclusive, we really ment exclsuive.
    You wont be able to play these games anywhere else besides the PlayStation only. As time passes on, Sony will explain and show more to the public of what the PlayStation 2 has for us in store. But the question is, can the PlayStation 2 live up to the hype? Can Microsoft compet with Sony with their very own consoles?
    Only time can tell! </b></p>
